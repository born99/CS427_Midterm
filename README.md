## Story
* To bring the inspiration for everybody around us to be motivated for preventing Covid-19, we create a wonderful name called ‚ÄúQuarantine‚Äù. \
* The game operation is quite simple, the doctor is on his way to bring vaccines to citizens, and he must dodge any viruses coming to avoid being infected, the longer he survives, the higher score you can get. \
* The idea behind this ‚ÄúEndless Runner Game‚Äù is to raise the awareness of people: _‚ÄúYou could be infected someday unless you stay at home‚Äù_. The game also extends our appreciations and thanks to the doctors who are doing their best fighting to viruses, despite the risk to save our world.

## Gameplay

* You control the docter and help him to dodge as much viruses as possible. The longer time he survives, the more he can help people.\

* As you can see from the pictures above, there are 3 ‚Äúheart‚Äù icon represents 3 HP, once it becomes 0, you will lose the game.\
The top right corner is the time (and the score) you survive.\
* Try to avoid all viruses, hit the black viruses, you will lose 2 HP, hit the new-created viruses, you lose 1 HP.


## How to play
* <kbd> **A** </kbd> __or__ <kbd> **ü†¶** </kbd>   : Move left\
* <kbd> **D** </kbd> __or__ <kbd> **ü†§** </kbd>     : Move right\
* <kbd>	**Spacebar** </kbd>&emsp;&nbsp;&ensp;        : Jump\
* <kbd> **J** </kbd>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;   : Dash

## Applications/Techniques
* As for the gameplay feature, we provide an endless runner gameplay. We set a looping background and ground to with different scroll speed to run endlessly on a ‚Äúparallax‚Äù scene.
* The viruses movement are based on particle system.
* We manage to minimize the hitbox while dashing.
* Most of the character are designed by us ourselves with meaningful purposes.
